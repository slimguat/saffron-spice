def denoise_data(row_data, denoise_sigma):
    """
    Apply denoising to a 3D data array containing NaN values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    row_data : np.ndarray
        3D data array to be denoised, containing NaN values.
    denoise_sigma : float
        Weight parameter used by the denoising algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The denoised 3D data array, with NaN values preserved.

    Notes
    -----
    This function replaces NaN values in the input data array by their mean
    values along the spectral axis, and then applies a denoising algorithm
    to the resulting array. The denoising is performed on a truncated version
    of the array, obtained by removing rows and columns that only contain NaN
    values. The final denoised array has the same shape as the input array,
    with NaN values in the same positions.

    This function assumes that the input array has dimensions (spectral_axis,
    x_axis, y_axis), where the spectral axis is the first dimension, and that
    the denoising algorithm is based on Anscombe variance stabilization.
